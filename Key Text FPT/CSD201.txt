What is the "push"? | Placing a data item on top of the stack.
What is "popping"? | Removing a data item from the top of the stack.
Explain LIFO | Last-In-First-Out. A stack is a LIFO storage mechanism because the last item inserted is the first one to be removed.
What is "peek"? | It allows the user to read the value at the top of the stack with out removing it.
Explain how you would create an algorithm that matches delimiters on the stack. Include errors in your explanation. | 1. Read the characters from a string one at a time.
What happens to non delimiter characters? | They are not inserted onto the stack; they are ignored.
Whatever you can do to manipulate the data storage structure becomes our: | Methods.
What is the difference between a stack and a queue? | In a queue the first item inserted is the first to be removed (FIFO). In a stack the last item inserted is the first to be removed (LIFO)
Where does the term queue come from? | It is a British reference to waiting in line. Fist in, first out.
Unlike a stack, the items in a queue don't always: | extend all the way down to index 0.
How is "peek" different in a queue? | It "peeks" at the value of the item at the front of the queue without removing it as opposed to the last value in a stack.
What is wrapping around? When is it useful? What is created that must be fixed? | Wrapping around allows the user to fill in new items in the queue at index zero, assuming that the queue is empty at index zero. This creates a broken sequence (the items in the queue are in two different sequences in the array).
How can you fix a broken sequence? What is created? | Delete enough items so that the Fron arrow wraps around. This creates a single contiguous sequence.
What is a deque? | A double-ended queue. You can insert items and either end & delete items from either end.
How is a priority queue different than a queue? | A priority queue items are ordered by key value so that the item with the lowest key ( or in some implementations the highest key) is always at the front. Items are inserted in the proper position to maintain the order.
How does the mail sorting analogy apply to the priority queue? | You insert a letter from the postman into your pile of pending letters according to priority. The higher the priority the higher the position in the pile.
What are the pros and cons of using a priority queue implemented by a simple array? | Pro: Simple and appropriate when the # of items isn't high or insertion speed isn't critical.
In a singly-linked list, these is no efficient way to insert node before a given node in the middle or at the end of the list | T
which of the following applications may use a queue | Store a waiting list of printing
select the most correct statement | sort is 0(n^2), best case it is O(n)
