XML gives you a way of packaging your data, and it's taken off largely because XML documents are text | which has meant that you can send them using the existing Internet framework, as built for HTML.
Notes, working drafts, candidate recommendations | and recommendations
An XML element is the basic data-holding construct in an XML document | It starts with an opening tag, can contain text or other elements, and ends with a closing tag, like this: <greeting>hello</greeting>
An attribute gives you more information, and is always assigned a quoted value in XML. | Here's how you might add an attribute named language to this element: <greeting language = "en">hello</greeting>.
he ones we discussed today are that an XML document must contain one or more elements. One element, the root element, must contain all the other elements. | Finally, each element must nest inside any enclosing elements correctly.
All XML processors are supposed to implement at least the UTF-8 (compressed Unicode) and UTF-16 (compressed UCS) character encodings | In practice, you can only count on UTF-8, however
You can escape < and > like this: <message>This is a &lt;message&gt; | element.</message>
A prolog can contain XML declarations, XML comments (which describe the XML document) | processing instructions, whitespace, and doctype declaration(s).
The attributes you can use in an XML document are: version (required; the XML version), encoding (optional; the character encoding), and standalone (optional; "yes" | if the document does not refer to any external documents or entities, "no" otherwise).
There are no processing instructions built into XML already, although some, like <?xml-stylesheet?> | have been generally agreed upon by browser manufacturers.
One. You need at least a root element for an XML document | to be well-formed
In a well-formed XML document, there must be one root element that contains | all the others.
he attribute values are not enclosed in | quotation marks.
You could use this attribute xmlns:service="http://www.superduperbigco.com/customer_service" in an element | After using this attribute, you can use the service prefix in the current element and any child elements.
Use this attribute in the enclosing element | xmlns="http://www.superduperbigco.com/customer_returns"
The <hiredate> and <name> elements are | not declared in the DTD
The <hiredate> and <name> elements appear | in the wrong order.
This DTD uses a choice for the <employee> element, and the choice says that the document can contain | either <hiredate> elements or <name> elements—but not both.
The DTD says there can be at most one <employee> element | but there are two
This XML document references an external DTD, so the XML declaration's standalone attribute should be set to "no". | There may also be errors in the external DTD, of course.
You can use the #IMPLIED keyword | address CDATA #IMPLIED
You can use the #FIXED keyword. | name CDATA #REQUIRED
The namespace that is used by XML schemas is | www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema

You can do this in an XML schema: | <xsd:attribute name="language" type="xsd:string" use="optional"/>.
You use the <xsd:restriction> element | and the base attribute.
To cap values, you can use the maxIncusive and maxExclusive facets. | To constrain values to be one of a set, you can use the enumeration facet.
You can use this CSS property/value pair: font-size: 36pt | You can use this CSS property/value pair: display: block
You can use this CSS property/value pair: text-align: center | You can use this CSS property/value pair: text-decoration: underline.  You can use this CSS property/value pair: margin-top: 10.
