12. Integrity | requires that the information is not changed or modified except by individuals authorized to do so.
16. Incremental backups | have a smaller backup window where files that have modified or changed are backed up. When the incremental backup is complete all archive bits are unchecked back to 0. The advantage is the backups are faster and the disadvantage is the restore process is longer and backups have to be restored in order. It is cumulative in nature.
17. Differential backups | have a larger backup window where the files that have changed or modified are backed up. After the incremental backup has occurred it does not uncheck the archive bit back to 0 as does the incremental backup, in other words with a differential backup the archive bit always reads 1. The disadvantage is the backup takes longer but the restore process is shorter as all that is needed is the last differential backup and the last full backup to restore

51. Signature Based Monitoring | is where an IPS or IDS examines network traffic, activity and transactions and look for well known patterns.
52. Anomaly Based Monitoring | is where an IPS or IDS establishes a baseline of normal activities over a given period of time. Then whenever a significant deviation for the baseline occurs it can detect it and sound an alarm. There are two issues with this form of detection and they are false alarms because sometimes network behavior changes rapidly and higher than usual network cost i.e. processing time.
53. Behavior-Based Monitoring | examines and analyzes the behavior of processes and programs and detect any abnormal activities. It can then decide to allow or block the activity. Its advantage is that it doesn't have to compile a baseline or update its signature files and as a result can quickly stop new attacks.
